# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project aims to classify handwritten digits using machine learning algorithms. The MNIST dataset is used for training and testing the models.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python (version >= 3.6)
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
  
## Usage
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `digit-recognition-using-tensorflow.ipynb`.

## Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of 91% on the test dataset.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add new features, improve the code, or fix bugs, feel free to open a pull request.
